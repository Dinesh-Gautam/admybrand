# Refactoring Plan for `src/app/dashboard/_components` - Stage 1

This document outlines the refactoring plan for the files in the `src/app/dashboard/_components` directory.

---

## File: `DashboardActions.tsx`

### 1. Enhance Documentation with JSDoc

- **Objective:** Improve clarity and maintainability by adding JSDoc comments.
- **Actions:**
  - Add JSDoc to the `DashboardActions` component, explaining its purpose and props.
  - Clarify the role of the `onFilterChange` prop.

---

## File: `DashboardCardGrid.tsx`

### 1. Refactor Card Rendering Logic

- **Objective:** Improve readability and maintainability by abstracting the conditional rendering of dashboard cards.
- **Current Issue:** The component has a long list of conditionally rendered cards directly in the JSX, which can become difficult to manage.
- **Proposed Solution:**
  - Create a configuration array that maps each card component to its corresponding filter property in the `filters` object.
  - Iterate over this array to render the cards. This makes the component more declarative and easier to update.

#### Example of a Card Configuration:

```typescript
const cardConfig = [
  { component: RealtimeValueCard, filter: 'RealTimeValue' },
  { component: SalesOverTimeCard, filter: 'SalesOverTime' },
  // ... other cards
];

// In the component:
{
  cardConfig.map(
    ({ component: CardComponent, filter }) =>
      filters[filter] && <CardComponent key={filter} />,
  );
}
```

### 2. Group Related Cards

- **Objective:** Improve the structure and readability of the grid by grouping related cards.
- **Actions:**
  - Create smaller functional components or simply group cards within the main component's render method using fragments, organized by category (e.g., "Sales Performance", "Acquisition", "Financials").

#### Example of Grouping:

```jsx
<>
  {/* Sales Performance */}
  <PlusSalesCard />
  <AdvancedSalesCard />
  <ProfessionalSalesCard />

  {/* Real-time Data */}
  {filters.RealTimeValue && <RealtimeValueCard />}
</>
```

This is already partially done with comments, but it can be more formally structured.

### 3. Add JSDoc Comments

- **Objective:** Document the component's purpose and props.
- **Actions:**
  - Add JSDoc to the `DashboardCardGrid` component.

---

## File: `DashboardHeader.tsx`

### 1. Add JSDoc Comments

- **Objective:** Improve clarity by adding JSDoc comments.
- **Actions:**
  - Add JSDoc to the `DashboardHeader` component to explain its simple role of displaying the page title.
