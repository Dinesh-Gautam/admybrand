# AI Usage Report: ADmyBRAND Insights

## AI Tools Used

- **Primary tools:** Roo-code, ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation, content creation, and planning.
- **Key use cases:** AI assisted in generating the initial project structure, drafting the README.md file, suggesting AI-powered features, and providing code snippets for components. It also helped in understanding project requirements and sample prompts.

## Sample Prompts (2-3)

1.  "Generate a modern responsive dashboard layout with cards and charts for a marketing analytics dashboard."
2.  "Suggest AI-powered features I can integrate into a marketing analytics dashboard built with Next.js, shadcn/ui, and Recharts."
3.  "Create a professional README.md file for a Next.js analytics project with AI components, including sections for features, tech stack, setup, and folder structure."

## AI vs Manual Work Split

- **AI-generated:** Approximately 40% of the initial scaffolding, README content, and sample prompts.
- **Manual coding:** Connecting components, integrating specific logic (e.g., real-time data simulation, AI feature implementation), refining UI/UX, ensuring responsiveness across all devices, and detailed styling.
- **Customization:** AI suggestions were personalized by adapting generated layouts to fit the project's specific data visualization needs, tweaking component styles to match the shadcn/ui design system, and integrating AI-generated code snippets into the existing codebase after review and modification.

## Developer Role

Most of the UI design and implementation was handled by the developer. While AI provided valuable suggestions for structure and code snippets, it was not sufficiently creative to produce the visually stunning and highly polished UIs required for a professional marketing dashboard. The developer's expertise was crucial in translating AI-generated concepts into a cohesive, aesthetically pleasing, and user-friendly interface, ensuring that the final product met high design standards.

**AI's Role in Development:**
AI played a significant role in accelerating the development process by providing a strong foundation for planning, structure, and design inspiration. It offered valuable code snippets and content drafts, significantly reducing the time spent on initial setup and documentation. However, the final code refinement, ensuring seamless responsiveness, implementing complex logic like real-time data simulation, and making critical design decisions were all performed manually. This approach emphasizes that AI served as a powerful assistant, augmenting human creativity and decision-making rather than replacing it.
