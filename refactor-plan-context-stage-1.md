# Refactoring Plan for `src/context` Directory - Stage 1

This document outlines the refactoring plan for the files in the `src/context` directory.

## File: `src/context/SidebarContext.tsx`

### 1. Enhance Documentation with JSDoc Comments

- **Objective:** Improve code clarity and maintainability by adding detailed JSDoc comments to all components and hooks.
- **Actions:**
  - Add JSDoc comments to the `SidebarProvider` component, explaining its purpose, the `children` prop, and what it provides.
  - Add JSDoc comments to the `useSidebar` hook, explaining what it does, its return value, and the requirement of being used within a `SidebarProvider`.

### Example of JSDoc for `useSidebar`:

```typescript
/**
 * Custom hook to access the sidebar context.
 *
 * @returns {SidebarContextType} The sidebar context, including sidebarOpen state and setters.
 * @throws {Error} If used outside of a SidebarProvider.
 */
export const useSidebar = () => {
  // ...
};
```

### 2. Review State Management and Single Responsibility

- **Objective:** Ensure the context is focused and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- **Analysis:**
  - The `SidebarContext` manages two related states: `sidebarOpen` and `alertsOpen`.
  - At present, these states are closely related to the sidebar's functionality.
- **Decision:**
  - For now, keeping both states within the same context is acceptable as it doesn't over-complicate the context's responsibility.
  - If the application grows and these states are used independently in unrelated parts of the app, consider splitting them into separate contexts (e.g., `SidebarContext` and `AlertsContext`).

### 3. General Code Quality and Best Practices

- **Objective:** Ensure the code follows modern React and TypeScript best practices.
- **Analysis:**
  - The code is already using functional components and hooks, which is good.
  - The use of `createContext`, `useContext`, and `useState` is appropriate.
  - The error handling in `useSidebar` for contexts used outside a provider is a good practice.
- **Actions:**
  - No major refactoring is needed in this area. The code is clean and follows modern standards.
